```

Tom van Woudenberg is a lecturer at Delft University of Technology. Equipped with a dedication to education in structural mechanics, I strive to cultivate a blended learning environment that engages students actively and rewards their efforts.

Tom graduated in 2020 at Delft University of Technology on structural optimisation. From August 2020 to August 2022, Tom worked at Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences as lecturer construction, specialised in structural mechanics. Since September 2022, Tom is working at Delft University of Technology.

Next to courses on structural mechanics, Tom (co)teaches courses on optimisation, numerical methods, data-analysis and statistics. Next to that, Tom supervises BSc- and MSc-students, partly on the research project of [Macaulay's method](https://teachbooks.io/Macaulays_method). Furthermore, Tom is actively involved in cross-faculty collaboration on [PRIMECH](https://www.tudelft.nl/teachingacademy/communities/primech), [TeachBooks](https://teachbooks.io/) and various digital tools for teaching like [ANS](https://ans.app/) and Git.
